The idea of website is to create a page that will help tourists to discover Albania.
Any one can share his own experience.

Anyone that will be registered can use it to find diffrent places and also has the 
right to post and share with others one place that he has visited.
Every user can delete or edit his post, but not the posts of the others.
Every user can like any post he wants. 

There are three main categories of places created:
1- Mountains that stands for wild nature tourism ect.
2- Beaches that is mostly focused for blue tourism.
3- Culture that is road to Albanian inheritance 

Posts with more likes will be catogrized directly at the page "Most liked".

Post can be created to put name of the place, description, 
location where need to be copy paste the link of google map.
uploading one image and post it.

In the dashboard is also a youtube video promotion for Albanian tourism.
